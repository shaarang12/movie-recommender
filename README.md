## Machine Learning Model
The recommendation system uses a Cosine Similarity to provide accurate recommendations.

## Frontend
The frontend of the Movie Recommender was built using Streamlit. It provides an intuitive user interface that allows users to select a movie from a dropdown list or type the name of a movie. Based on their selection, the frontend communicates with the machine learning model to provide real-time movie recommendations. Users can easily discover movies that are similar to their preferences, making the movie selection process more enjoyable and personalized.
